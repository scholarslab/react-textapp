They went to Tech and they went to Berkeley High [School, Berkeley, California] mainly. And in Tech in those days, we had to wear uniforms. We had to wear a white middy and a dark skirt so that everybody looked equal cause these kids would come to school in chauffeured limousines. Tech had very few blacks. I was the first black valedictorian in the graduating class, me. And I remember I spoke on the arts. And I was such a crybaby--I, I was always the class speaker or the class president from grammar school, junior high and high school, and I would cry at each one of them, could hardly get my little speech out before I&#39;d be crying and carrying--and my mother used to say, &quot;please, don&#39;t cry. Please don&#39;t die crying cause if you die crying they&#39;re going to have bury you face down. You look so bad when you cry.&quot; So I was up there struggling not to cry. And I would always cry. And so that was funny.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">So what courses were you good at in school? I mean what classes did you like or what subject matters did you like?<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Um, public speaking. I liked public speaking. I never took acting in school. I didn&#39;t ever take dance in the dance group cause they were doing amateur dancing, I thought. And I&#39;d already passed that stuff. I was just an average student. I had to work hard for what I got. My brothers, I always said they all got the brains and I just got the brawn cause one brother went into, graduated from [University of] Cal[ifornia at Berkeley, Berkeley, California], Cal in biology and the other one was in law. So they were the brains. And when I went to Cal, they would guide me on what classes to take and I was the baby sister. I used to, oh, I used to die cause I&#39;d see these cute guys and I&#39;d come home and say, &quot;Mama, Beck said, introduced me, &#39;this is my kid sister&#39;&quot; and I would die. And I was their kid sister. And it used to always bug me because they were both Alpha [Phi Alpha, fraternity] men. And so the Alpha guys would come over, and I&#39;d get all excited--&quot;this is my kid sister.&quot; And I&#39;d say, &quot;there it goes.&quot; But anyway I had a good time, and they guided me through.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">And when it was time for you to graduate, was there any thought that you would go, you know, straight on or were there other things that you--<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">You mean from college--I didn&#39;t graduate--<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Oh, not from college, from high school.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Oh, I knew I&#39;d go on to Cal.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Okay.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">That was just automatic. Okay, okay.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">But Cal only had--they had no dance majors at Cal. The only dance major here was at Mills College [Oakland, California], which was a private, all-girls school of the very wealthy. So when I went to Cal I had to physical education, which was the closest, but I always liked tennis and sports anyway so it didn&#39;t bother me. So I did that.<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x000000000107000000010000000101000000aa0ce36f2cf569c1117aec80f8605141","tags":null,"widgets":null,"presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#00aeff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.80","fill_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_opacity":"1.00","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"16","zindex":null,"weight":null,"start_date":"1944-01-01","end_date":null,"after_date":null,"before_date":null,"point_image":"https:\/\/scholarslab.net\/historymakers\/files\/original\/6386ffe739b233684186b76b48526f83.png","wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":"7","max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"11","map_focus":"-13614657.728148,4551117.991237"},

And just, I think because--my mother [Cora Beckford] used to say I used to kick to the rhythm of the beat in my crib. So I&#39;ve always had dance. It was just a part of my life. I never thought it was special. My mother never let me think I was special cause I could dance &#39;cause she used to always say, &quot;you know, there&#39;s always somebody who can kick higher than you.&quot; So it kept me grounded. But dance has always been a part--and family because every Sunday we used to go to my grandmother&#39;s [Rosa Fowler] house three blocks away. And it was always--in those days they had what they called family socials. And people used to recite Paul Laurence Dunbar [poet]--my aunt was a great Paul Laurence Dunbar reciter. She could do the dialect and everything. And my piano teacher, who quietly told my mother, &quot;save your money,&quot; &#39;cause I was such a bad pianist, &#39;cause I didn&#39;t want to practice. And the only reason I took it was because my dance teacher said, &quot;if you&#39;re going to be a dancer, you have to know how to play--you have to know music.&quot; So I struggled along, but they lived on the corner so they would come do piano recitals. So my grandmother&#39;s house was like a meeting place on Sundays. And we&#39;d have teas and, you know, hors d&#39;oeuvres and stuff. And, and we would always--my sister [Roselyn Beckford] used to play the piano. She was a good pianist. My brothers [Felix and Fowler Beckford], one played the violin and one played the saxophone and I danced. So it was always a little due--<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">And that was, that was your mother&#39;s side of the family--<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">(Nods for yes).<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">--and all the socials.

And in those days all black children took tapdancing. I mean they went and took tap. And, but Daddy&#39;s contacts with the wealthy whites from doing their cars, told him of Florelle Batsford&#39;s [dance] studio in downtown Oakland [California]. She only catered to the very wealthy white kids. I was her only black student. And we knew we could not afford the take lessons. So my mother--I told you my mother was very creative. My mother went to her and said, &quot;we&#39;ll clean the studio for my daughter&#39;s lessons.&quot; And it was always done late at night, and they [fellow dancers] never knew that&#39;s how we paid for my lessons. And I can remember as a little girl that my job was to empty the ashtrays and straighten the magazines. And so that&#39;s how I paid for my lessons the whole seventeen years I was with Florelle Batsford. And I just wonder how many parents today would do that. So my mother was way ahead of her time, all the time.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Now, you&#39;re absolutely right for lots of different reasons.

And Florelle Batsford really cared for our family, and really cared for me a lot. So she would always feature me in the recitals with an acrobatic dance or come out and dance on point in ballet. And I did all those things. And I can remember backstage, the little, other little white children looking at me and, and some would touch--you know, they, they weren&#39;t exposed to black people who were on their level to pay, they thought, for dancing classes too. And my mother made all my costumes and so they never knew. But, and then I, I was determined to outdance them also. So that when I&#39;d go on the stage, they would have go &quot;whoa&quot; cause Daddy would always say, &quot;do your best, do your best.&quot; So I always worked at it.<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x00000000010100000000000000000000000000000000000000","tags":"training","widgets":"Simile,Waypoints","presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#d500ff","fill_color_select":"#d500ff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.30","fill_opacity_select":"0.40","stroke_opacity":"0.90","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"10","zindex":null,"weight":"1","start_date":"1929","end_date":"1944","after_date":null,"before_date":null,"point_image":null,"wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":null,"max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"12","map_focus":"-13611969.891709,4555167.3622428"},

When I walked into that great big gymnasium at UC Berkeley, when I went to get my leotard from the check-out thing, the lady on the checkout desk went (mimes wide-eyed expression). I said, &quot;I&#39;ll take one leo&quot;--that set me off, right? Said &quot;I&#39;ll take one leotard for Modern Dance.&quot; Took my leotard, put it on, walked up the ramp to Room 230--I&#39;ll never forget the room. It&#39;s a huge--it&#39;s one of the biggest rooms in the women&#39;s gym. And when I walked in the room, all around the wall, long room (unclear) there were about a hundred-fifty white girls warming up in Modern Dance. And when I opened the door and walked in, it was science fiction. The room went (makes whooshing noise). It froze. (Laughs). They had never seen a black dancer at UC Berkeley. I walked in, went and sat on the floor against the wall and just relaxed and watched them--pretty soon they all went back to warming up. And I know they wondered, &quot;why isn&#39;t she warming and getting ready.&quot; I just sat there, and said, &quot;that&#39;s warming up? They can&#39;t kick, they can&#39;t&quot;--so the teacher walked in. I got up and got on the front row, center, had never done Modern dance. But I said, &quot;you can only kick it so many ways and arms so many ways and I know I can do that, right.&quot; Got on the front row. The class was such a breeze and it was so easy that after class, the teacher said, &quot;Ms. Beckford, may I speak to you?&quot; All the class was, they were going down the ramp to get into their--change clothes. So Ms. Caryl Cuddeback, who I owe a lot to, she&#39;s passed on, she said, &quot;it&#39;s evident that you&#39;re too advanced for this class. I want you to come and take the Advanced Modern Dance class.&quot; So, same thing happened when I walked into the Advance Modern Dance class. Now, they could dance, but I said, they&#39;re still, haven&#39;t got the years I had. So I got on the front row again and did the class easily. It was just another way to move your body. So after the class, Caryl Cuddeback said, &quot;you&#39;re really too advanced for this class too. I want you to come to San Francisco [California] and study where I study, at the Anna Halprin-Welland Lathrop Modern Dance Professional Studio.&quot; She said &quot;still take this class.&quot; And so every Thursday, we would drive over together. And I would go to Anna Halprin-Welland Lathrop Dance Studio on Union Street in San Francisco, now, which is a plush street, but then it was just Union Street. Of course, when I walked in there, the students--(mimes wide-eyed expression)--a black Modern dancer. Well, Anna Halprin and Welland Lathrop just embraced me cause they wanted dancers. And Anna and I to this day are very close. Her granddaughter is named after me. I mean she&#39;s Jewish; I&#39;m black. We just embrace. She&#39;s just a good soul and we&#39;ve been friends since forty--the early &#39;40s [1940s]. So when I went to their school, I got on the back row there cause these were pros. I said, &quot;mm-mm, I&#39;d better get in the back. This is no college group.&quot; But I worked very hard and got into their company and was the only black in the company. And when we&#39;d come out on stage, cause they were the top. And Welland and them had beautiful costumes too. And I can remember we were doing [Johann Sebastian] Bach partite and I had a solo. And I came out in the center of the stage with this beautiful bronze, fitted and in a full skirt, and you could hear the audience go--(inhales deeply)--&quot;what is a black woman doing up there doing this?&quot; And, of course, that just made me kick harder, turn better, do everything. So I credit them with being very courageous to put me as one of their featured people in their company, which was top stuff. And everywhere we&#39;d go, we had to, &quot;what is this? What is that?&quot; Didn&#39;t bother me because of my home training.<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x00000000010100000000000000000000000000000000000000","tags":"training","widgets":"Simile,Waypoints","presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#d500ff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.30","fill_opacity_select":"0.40","stroke_opacity":"0.90","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"10","zindex":null,"weight":"6","start_date":"1944","end_date":"1947","after_date":null,"before_date":null,"point_image":null,"wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":null,"max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"12","map_focus":"-13611969.891709,4555167.3622428"},

And he said, &quot;you need to go and audition for Katherine Dunham [dancer, choreographer].&quot; I had never even heard of Katherine Dunham. I knew &#39;Cabin in the Sky&#39; was playing in San Francisco [California] starring Ethel Waters [actress] and, and Katherine Dunham. And so my mother [Cora Beckford] got tickets, and we went over to the Curran Theatre to a matinee in San Francisco. Curran is still there. And we saw the show. And I had never, ever seen black people dance like that with all these elegant costumes cause Mr. [John] Pratt was her costumer and did fabulous costumes. So when the show was through, we, we went down the stage entrance and went in, and asked to meet Ms. Dunham. And she was very gracious and said,--well, this is the mat--this is between show, the matinee and evening show. So most of the dancers would go eat and kind of rest. But she had her entire company go sit down in the audience, a darkened theater and I did my acrobatic dance for her company and her. And I had a finger cymbal dance where you put round finger symbols and you would play them yourself. That was my only accompaniment, was my finger cymbal. And I remember I had on a kind of Egyptian outfit with balloon pants and a gold top and a gold--did my little dance. Got through. Ms. Dunham came back. The company then went on to eat or whatever they were going to do. And Ms. Dunham came back and said, &quot;that was just wonderful.&quot; She always talked soft. &quot;I would like for you to sign seven years contract and dance with the company.&quot; And, of course, I was overwhelmed and flattered and carried on. And, and I said, &quot;but I&quot;--she said, &quot;well, just think about it. Come back tomorrow, and in three weeks we&#39;ll be here studying repertoire. You can learn the Dunham Technique, learn the repertoire. And we&#39;re getting ready to go up to Canada. And we&#39;ll be gone for just three weeks, and you can come along and do that, study here for three weeks, tour three weeks.&quot; And I was so excited. We could hardly get home. That night at dinner, at dinner table cause we always sat down and had dinner together. I said, &quot;Ms. Dunham said I can sign for seven years and travel with them, and oh, that was going to be so great.&quot; And I asked Mama and Daddy [Felix Beckford] &quot;what should I do?&quot; And they said, you do what you think you should do. And I knew education was always the highlight in our family. Get your education, get your education. And if I had not had an education and got injured in dance, where would I be? A dumb ex-dancer. So I went back that next day, my mother and I went back over to the studio and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I won&#39;t be able to join your company. I have to go to college.&quot; And because Ms. Dunham was scholar herself, I think she respected that, and said, &quot;well, would you like to learn the technique and travel with us up to Canada for three weeks? Can you get out of high school?&quot; Well, that was my Senior year. I was seventeen and I knew I had finished all my requirements. So Mama said, &quot;yeah, you can do that.&quot; And so Ms. Dunham said, &quot;but your mother will have to come with you cause you&#39;re too young for the company.&quot; I don&#39;t think she knew I was seventeen cause I looked so young. And so Mama toured with us. And Mama became the company Mother. And I was like the pet of the company cause I was the baby and Ms. Dunham always kind of sheltered me. So I had a good time for those, for that tour. And when we got back--well with that tour, let me say, that was my first time to give autographs. I was so excited. It was the first time to get flowers backstage from people I didn&#39;t even know; first time to, you know, people would be lined up in the stage entrance, you know. So it was really like a superstar, and that was a thrill &#39;cause here I was always the only black dancer in Florelle Batsford&#39;s recitals. So that was really an eye opener. First, of all dancing with other people on the stage, dancing my culture, dancing barefoot with drums. And Ms. Dunham featured me in some of the numbers. So that was wonderful.<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x00000000010700000001000000010100000096ecd8a6a7fd69c19d7d0a3dbb5a5141","tags":"training, subtitle","widgets":"Waypoints","presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#d500ff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#d500ff","fill_opacity":"0.80","fill_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_opacity":"1.00","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"20","zindex":null,"weight":"3","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"after_date":"1943","before_date":"1944","point_image":"https:\/\/scholarslab.net\/historymakers\/files\/original\/98b911ab4dc3c110ab3486872fa614f3.png","wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":"7","max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"13","map_focus":"-13626685.21398,4549356.9537653"},

And that was Robert Taylor, my partner in that, and I was supposed to be a shopkeeper that was flirting with death. And that chair on top of my head is the kind of chairs the Haitians ladies sat on to sell their market wares. It&#39;s close to the floor and they would sit there. So &#39;Banda&#39; was supposed to be a scary dance, and I&#39;m frightened away from him.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">[Ruth Beckford (right) with Robert Taylor performing &#39;Banda&#39; as part of the Ruth Beckford African-Haitian Dance Company, Berkeley, California, n.d.

And zombies, I think were actually people who had been drugged and put into such a state that they would wander around and--it&#39;s like a mental problem with people here you see walking down the street, talking to themselves. Zombies--I believe anyway, I don&#39;t know if they believe it--but I believe were put into a mental state by drugs. And they would work the fields for hours and hours on end, and they were believed to have been pulled up from the dead. So this dance, I had all the men&#39;s faces covered so that they didn&#39;t&#39;--their features weren&#39;t visible. And this, with their bodies bowed was where I was pulling them out of the earth, and they first bowed their spines like that before they came up. It was a very eerie dance, all done in blacks and whites and grays. And so the zombies came to life and danced.<\/div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">[Dancers performing a zombie dance as part of the Ruth Beckford African-Haitian Dance Company, n.d.

I did not want to be a PE [Physical Education] teacher. The Physical Ed Department really hated the dance girls. And so once I got in that Advanced Dance class, then they had what they called the Orchesis Modern Dance Honor Society, which was a national organization. And that was saved for the very best dancers. And I was initiated into that the first year. So there was really nowhere else to go. I stayed two and a half years at Cal cause I knew the body sciences were also important to know, for teaching dance. And I knew I enjoyed teaching. My first teaching experience was when I was fourteen. And I had said we had a big two-car garage cemented. And I made that a dance studio on Saturday afternoons. And for fifteen cents, no, it was ten cents cause you got five--okay, you got fifteen minutes of tap dance and fifteen minutes of ballet ten cents, dancing classes. Always--pay for what you know. So the neighborhood kids would come and pay ten cents and take ballet and tap. And I knew I enjoyed teaching and could break it down to make it easy. So that old saying of &quot;those who can&#39;t, teach,&quot; was a joke to me cause I performed and taught. So I enjoyed teaching. So after I got into Orchesis and had already been in Advance [Dance, class at Cal], and I&#39;d taken my body sciences, there was no reason for me to stay at Cal. And I&#39;d walked into this job [teaching recreational dance classes] with the City [of Oakland, California] which was really what I wanted to do. And there was no one&#39;s footsteps I had to follow because this was the first in the whole United States. So I made my own philosophy. And my philosophy was to train the individual to have the same kind of self-esteem and assurance and confidence that I had received in my family.<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x000000000107000000010000000101000000d6fde3646ff569c18409c8f31c665141","tags":null,"widgets":null,"presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#00aeff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.80","fill_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_opacity":"0.90","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"16","zindex":null,"weight":null,"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"after_date":null,"before_date":null,"point_image":"https:\/\/scholarslab.net\/historymakers\/files\/original\/6386ffe739b233684186b76b48526f83.png","wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":"7","max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"12","map_focus":"-13611969.891709,4555167.3622428"},

So at the time Oakland Ensemble Theater [Oakland, California], the director was one of my students. He taught at Merritt College [Oakland, California] in Drama, Ron Stacker Thompson, who&#39;s like a brother to me. And he and his wife started Oakland Ensemble Theater. And they had me on the board because I knew about National Endowment for the Arts and all that stuff. So he said, &quot;oh, girl, we&#39;re getting ready to do a play, you need to audition for this play.&quot; I said, &quot;un-un. Actors are too strange, dancers are more disciplined. And dancers are this and actors are strange,&quot; and I went through all this, right. And he said, &quot;no, girl, you got to audition for this part.&quot; I said, &quot;Ron, I could never memorize all those words you all have to say.&quot; He said, &quot;well, you can memorize every step for two hours when you&#39;re on stage.&quot; I said, &quot;okay, I&#39;ll audition.&quot; And the play was &#39;Happy Ending.&#39; Douglas Turner Ward&#39;s play. And it was these two sisters who worked for this wealthy white family. And as we said, every time I&#39;d buy them two chops, I&#39;d buy ten for us &#39;cause I ran all the business. So it was really a funny play. And they were going to get a divorce, and we could not let them get a divorce. There goes our silk, our satin, our everything. So that was what the play was--and &#39;Happy Ending&#39; was we kept them together. So I auditioned for this part and got the part. And I told Ron, &quot;I can&#39;t do this play.&quot; He said, &quot;you got the part.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t do it.&quot; I said, &quot;I cannot memorize all of this.&quot; Well, me not wanting my ego to be hit, I started memorizing that play, honey, and did the show. And the critics came, and I got written up in the paper. You&#39;d think my name had never been in the paper before. All these years I&#39;ve been written up. I was so excited. I said, &quot;oh, I got a good review.&quot; Ron said, &quot;you always get&quot;--I said, &quot;not acting &#39;cause this is not my stuff.&quot; So I said &quot;for a bootleg actor, and I got a good review.&quot; That was the bug.

Like I had a little dance of just the street sounds. And it opened with a big oil jug on my head hollering &quot;oil.&quot; I was the lady who sold the oil. And I would come down--you know, they sort of sway. They don&#39;t walk, they just sort of ooze down the street. And I&#39;d have this big oil thing on my head, and I would holler &quot;oil.&quot; And I would, I was the first one on the stage. Then there&#39;d come the man who used to shine shoes. However, most people in Haiti had no shoes, but the elite wore shoes. And he would tap on his drum, on his shoeshine box a rhythm so you&#39;d hear that. Then there&#39;d be another man selling sweets. So all these vendors would be coming down into the marketplace. So I did a whole dance on just the marketplace.

And I don&#39;t want to be in that kind of play.&quot; So I said, &quot;I think I&#39;ll write my own play.&quot; So I wrote, &#39;Tis the Morning of My Life,&#39; which was a very wealthy black family, older woman, younger man romance. Boy, it hit this town, the--it sold out before we opened. It sold out before we opened. Well, I wrote the first draft and had the concept. Then Ron, who&#39;s the real writer, wrote the finished product. And I was the producer and the writer and the star. So I--being the producer, I didn&#39;t have auditions. I picked the best-looking young actor I knew, and I picked the other people. It was my daughter-in-law, her husband, one grandchild and my lover. So it was a small play. I knew from having been in other big plays like &#39;Richard III&#39; and stuff, I didn&#39;t want to be around all that drama and stuff with actors. And I said, &quot;that&#39;s too many people in a show.&quot; So I said, &quot;I&#39;ll do my play with just a small cast.&quot; Plus, as a producer, that&#39;s fewer costumes,--you know, you think about all that. And it was such a fun play, and the play locally had never seen real love scenes. I played real love scenes. And we dressed sharp. And most theaters, small theaters have, I call &quot;early Salvation Army furniture.&quot; I said, &quot;I can&#39;t have that.&quot; I went out to, what was the name of this place, Abbey Rents, told them, &quot;I will put your name in the programs, 300 people will see your name every night. Just let us borrow the furniture.&quot; He said, go on (unclear).&quot; I had brand new white furniture. I had brand--every, it was a great set. And not that painting that I did, but I painted another painting that I did to hang in the show because Roxie who was my aunt&#39;s name--I had all my characters, aunts, Roxie was a painter. And she went to the senior center every--and painted. And, but in shopping in the same supermarket, you talk to people in supermarket you wouldn&#39;t talk to out on the street. And this young man was always trying to read a recipe and trying to--and it came that he was newly divorced and trying to cook and we would start talking in the supermarket. And, and he was trying to figure out how to cook cornbread. And I said, &quot;hey, young man, you can come--I live near here, and I&#39;ll show you how to cook.&quot; And in the supermarket I always had on loose clothes. So when he came to the house, I had my apron tied, and he looked at some curves and things. And so, but my grand--but my son was a real chauvinist pig and grandmother was grandmother, no makeup, gray wig, loose clothes, come back the cake and go home. Go join the senior center, that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do. So my grand--his wife, my, my daughter-in-law, said &quot;Roxie, you need to get out, you&#39;re still young. You got a life, you look good, almost better than me. You need to get--.&quot; &quot;Oh, no, I couldn&#39;t have a man, but--.&quot; So this young man, when he came to the house and brought a bottle of wine and I cooked--and we enjoyed talking together and he said &quot;Roxie, I haven&#39;t had such a good time&quot;--<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x000000000107000000010000000101000000130ebd3ff7f569c16cec121818685141","tags":"theater","widgets":"Simile","presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#0022ff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.80","fill_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_opacity":"0.90","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"16","zindex":null,"weight":null,"start_date":"1984","end_date":null,"after_date":null,"before_date":null,"point_image":"https:\/\/scholarslab.net\/historymakers\/files\/original\/79a749f36b941360a73b0038deebee87.png","wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":"7","max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"12","map_focus":"-13611969.891709,4555167.3622428"},

Well, I was very good at sports and I said, &quot;well, I&#39;ll go teach tennis, you know.&quot; So when I went down to apply for the job, they said, &quot;we don&#39;t--we&#39;re, we&#39;re all filled up with recreation directors. We&#39;re looking for someone to teach rhythmics.&quot; They didn&#39;t know what to call it. I said &quot;I can teach that.&quot; And they said, &quot;well, how do you know?&quot; I said, &quot;well, I&#39;m a Modern Dance Honor Society,&quot; which was &#39;Orchesis&#39; at Cal, &quot;and I&#39;ve danced all these years.&quot; So they said, &quot;we&#39;ve never had this before.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;ll establish the program.&quot; And at that time, I took the accompanist at Cal, Ms. Lovejoy, &#39;cause I said, &quot;I&#39;m, I will not have a class with canned music,&quot; because kids heard canned music all the time. I wanted them exposed to pianists. So I made sure my budget would allow for pianists. And, took Ms. Lovejoy. We went down to west Oakland [California], and nobody knew--hadn&#39;t heard of the word Modern dance &#39;cause this was the projects, shipyard children, needing something to do after school. And I did lecture demonstrations. I would do, by myself, dance and explain it, and get sign-ups. I also won the parents over because I said, &quot;this is something for your children to do. We&#39;ll give a show at the end. It&#39;s all free, costumes will be free.&quot; So all the kids came. And they were so successful. And they were in west Oakland, and I, my nickname in the whole community was &quot;here come the Dance Lady&quot;. So the &quot;Dance Lady&quot; would come. By the time I got to the center, all these were like--would all be there ready to take dance. Well, I also established the philosophy that in recreational dance, it&#39;s training the person, not the activity. So dance was not my goal to make great dancers. I wanted to make strong, self-esteem high, confident little girls. And it was all black children then. So that the little girl who was, who was very fat, I would never let them make fun of her. I said, &quot;oh, we can&#39;t dance to today.&quot; &quot;Oh, Ms. Beckford, we want to dance today.&quot; I said, &quot;oh, no. We need to sit down, and we need to think about what we&#39;ve said.&quot; And I said, &quot;we can never do that again. We can never call anybody out of name. And because, if you want to be a dancer, you can&#39;t do that, cause if you do that, I&#39;ll have to put you out of class.&quot; And we always had waiting lists. They knew that. And, &quot;and we can&#39;t fight cause if you fight, you can&#39;t be a dancer, and I&#39;ll have to put you out of class. You have to have clean fingernails. You can&#39;t bite your fingernails.&quot; And the mothers would come and say, &quot;how did you get my daughter to stop biting her fingernails?&quot; I said, because I said, &quot;you scare me, oh, you scare me. You have to stand on the last row.&quot; The next week they&#39;d come and show me a little bit, &quot;oh, you are so beautiful you can come up&quot;--. So this kind of self-esteem. I had my hair, and that was strange. And I wore bright colors and that was strange. And I didn&#39;t live in the area cause I lived in north Oakland and not west Oakland, and, and I became friends with all the people on the street and everything, and the pimps and prostitutes. They&#39;d all go, &quot;here come that Dance Lady,&quot; and they wouldn&#39;t let any people curse around--it was funny. It was funny. I had a grand time. And, I can remember one time there was a, two gangs were rioting. What were they called, the Chucoes and the something else. And at that time, I had a, a convertible Cadillac [automobile]. And I can remember there were fight--it started with two little kids. They went home and got the big brothers, big brothers went home and got the mother and father. It was a whole riot almost. And I was in the bathroom and the other recreational directors were in the office. And one of the guys came and said, &quot;come on, Ms. Beckford, we&#39;re getting you out of here,&quot; one of the gang folks. And I knew the other recreation--some of their cars had been damaged. When I got out, these guys were surrounding my car, not a scratch, not a dent, no canvas cut. They said, &quot;you get in your car and you leave.&quot; So I had the support of all of the bad ones and the tough ones &#39;cause I was teaching their sisters. So those kind of little stories that come along.<\/div>\n","coverage":"0x00000000010700000001000000010100000092973547e3f669c126a8e166375e5141","tags":"teaching","widgets":"Simile,Waypoints","presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#7b00ff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.80","fill_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_opacity":"0.90","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"16","zindex":null,"weight":"7","start_date":"1947","end_date":"1968","after_date":null,"before_date":null,"point_image":"https:\/\/scholarslab.net\/historymakers\/files\/original\/98b911ab4dc3c110ab3486872fa614f3.png","wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":"7","max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"13","map_focus":"-13610976.210343,4553008.0161941"},

I wouldn&#39;t let--every year we would give a concert. And every year I would tell them, &quot;we cannot dance about a story that&#39;s already written. We can&#39;t dance about Cinderella. That person made up that story. We can&#39;t dance about things that&quot;--so I&#39;d make them make up their own stories. This is six year-olds up, &quot;stand up in front of the class and tell us your story.&quot; So they were learning public speaking. I would tell the audience, &quot;a good audience is respectful and doesn&#39;t laugh at someone&#39;s&quot;--so they learned how to sit quietly. This person stood at six and told their story. Then we would vote on which dance we wanted to do. So in my Legacy book, you&#39;ll see the program of, of the &#39;Wind Dance&#39; and the &#39;Egg Dance&#39; and all these strange little dances. But they were their originals. So they were the creator. So I taught them, &quot;you&#39;re more valuable creating it than doing &#39;Cinderella&#39; or the &#39;Three Little Pigs.&#39;&quot; And so that by the time we got to the concert, they knew--I did eyeball control. I never had to act crazy with them--I said, &quot;you know, we&#39;re ladies.&quot; I used to call a lot of them their last names. &quot;Ms. Brown, Ms. Smith, is that the way&quot;--so they began to stand straighter. And their parents began to see that so all the parents were just--they would just love me to come and teach their children. So that you could tell a Modern Dance girl walking down the street cause she had an air about her. She had an aura about her. And a lot of these girls now, &#39;cause I started teaching when I was twenty-one. And I always looked a little younger so they--I had to start them calling me &quot;Ms. Beckford&quot; right off because I knew if I let them get that familiarity, I&#39;d never get it &#39;cause a lot of these girls I taught had babies and they&#39;d been out there a long time. And I was just little old me from north Oakland [California]. So I, I started them calling me &quot;Ms. Beckford&quot; right off the bat and being very constant. You couldn&#39;t be mean one day--so that got the respect of the classes. They couldn&#39;t chew gum. They couldn&#39;t curse. They had to have their hair combed. They had to have deodorant. I told them all, &quot;go home, get your parents to buy your own deodorant cause dancers ought to smell good. Wash your own leotard every week.&quot; So these are things that, life skills. And those girls to this day are close.<\/div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/virginia-thehistorymakers-org.proxy01.its.virginia.edu\/story\/16428\" target=\"_blank\">HistoryMakers&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n","coverage":"0x00000000010100000000000000000000000000000000000000","tags":null,"widgets":"Waypoints","presenter":"StaticBubble","fill_color":"#00aeff","fill_color_select":"#00aeff","stroke_color":"#000000","stroke_color_select":"#000000","fill_opacity":"0.30","fill_opacity_select":"0.40","stroke_opacity":"0.90","stroke_opacity_select":"1.00","stroke_width":"2","point_radius":"10","zindex":null,"weight":"8","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"after_date":"1947","before_date":"1968","point_image":null,"wms_address":null,"wms_layers":null,"min_zoom":null,"max_zoom":null,"map_zoom":"13","map_focus":"-13610976.210343,4553008.0161941"},

During the colonial era, early settlements in the Virginia Colony were formed along the river. It was at the center of a major theater of battle in the American Civil War, where tens of thousands of troops fought against each other. Some 10,000 African-American slaves escaped across the river to Union lines and freedom, after the first Battle of Fredericksburg. Due to the river's significance as an obstacle to north-south movements, it effectively functioned as the boundary of the eastern theater of the war, between the \"North\" (the Union) and the \"South\" (the Confederate States of America).

The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along river banks.
