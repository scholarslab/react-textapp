During the colonial era, early settlements in the Virginia Colony were formed along the river. It was at the center of a major theater of battle in the American Civil War, where tens of thousands of troops fought against each other. Some 10,000 African-American slaves escaped across the river to Union lines and freedom, after the first Battle of Fredericksburg. Due to the river's significance as an obstacle to north-south movements, it effectively functioned as the boundary of the eastern theater of the war, between the \"North\" (the Union) and the \"South\" (the Confederate States of America).

The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along river banks.

The Minho slumbers<br \/>\r\nIn winter, nor does the Snake<br \/>\r\nRemember August. Hilarious, the Canadian<br \/>\r\nIs solid ice. The Madeira slavers<br \/>\r\nAcross the thawing fields, and the Plata laughs.<br \/>\r\nThe Dvina soaks up the snow. The Sava&rsquo;s<br \/>\r\nTemperature is above freezing. The Avon<br \/>\r\nCarols noiselessly. The Dr&ocirc;me presses<br \/>\r\nGrass banks; the Adige&rsquo;s frozen<br \/>\r\nSurface is like gray pebbles.<br \/>\r\nBirds circle the Ticino. In winter<br \/>\r\nThe Var was dark blue, unfrozen. The<br \/>\r\nThwaite, cold, is choked with sandy ice;<br \/>\r\nThe Ard&egrave;che glistens feebly through the freezing rain.<\/p>\r\n",

During the colonial era, early settlements in the Virginia Colony were formed along the river. It was at the center of a major theater of battle in the American Civil War, where tens of thousands of troops fought against each other. Some 10,000 African-American slaves escaped across the river to Union lines and freedom, after the first Battle of Fredericksburg. Due to the river's significance as an obstacle to north-south movements, it effectively functioned as the boundary of the eastern theater of the war, between the \"North\" (the Union) and the \"South\" (the Confederate States of America).

The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along river banks.
